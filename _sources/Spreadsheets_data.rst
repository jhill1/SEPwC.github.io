Moving from spreadsheets to data
=================================

We often use spreadsheets to store data, visualise those data and even analyise it. It's therefore useful
to think about the differences between a spreadsheet of data and what a computer will do with it.

When loading data into a program you are **parsing** the data from a file into variables. Whilst this
can be done manually, there are libraries and tools to help us do this for most common
data formats.
