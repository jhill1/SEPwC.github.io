Welcome to Solving Environmental Problems with Code (SEPwC)
===========================================================

The aim of this module is to teach you the basics of writing simple computer scripts so 
that you can analyse data to help solve problems. These data may be spatial (i.e. like GIS)
or text (e.g. transcripts of interviews) or collected in the field (so you can do some stats).

By the end of this module you should be able to wite a relatively simple script from 
scratch which can load in data, processes it and produce some meaningful output.

We will teach both R and Python and you can choose which one to learn (or even both!). 

The table below contains suggestions of which blocks of works to cover in each week
to help guide you. However, you can forge ahead, but equally, don't worry if you
slip behind a little.
