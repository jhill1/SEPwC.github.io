R: the fundamentals
====================

We're now going to learn the basics of a language. If you've chosen 
R, keep reading. If you've chosen Python :ref:`go to this section<Python: the fundamentals>`.

Computer languages are much simpler than natural languages, but much
stricter. We have to get the syntax correct or things won't work. However
interpreted languages tell you what is wrong, so it's not as bad as it sounds.

R tools of the trade
-----------------------

On all systems, install the latest version of `R <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html>`_.

`Rstudio <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>`_ is also very useful on all systems. R is relatively simple to 
keep up-to-date and install additional packages. Every so often it's worth deleting packages installed in your home space
for older versions. There's a brief introduction to :ref:`RStudio` in the :ref:`Software Development` section. It might be worth going there
and coming back here at this point.
