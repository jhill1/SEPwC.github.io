Adding files
------------

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory.
You should be in the `planets` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/Desktop/planets

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
We'll use `nano` to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier. But remember, 
the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the 
editor you choose (it might not be `nano`).

.. code-block:: bash

   nano mars.txt

Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

.. code-block:: output

    Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

Let's first verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

.. code-block:: bash

   ls

.. code-block:: output

    mars.txt

``mars.txt`` contains a single line, which we can see by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat mars.txt

.. code-block:: output

    Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

.. code-block:: bash

   git status

.. code-block:: output

    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
     (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

     mars.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

.. code-block:: bash

   git add mars.txt

and then check that the right thing happened:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git status

.. code-block:: output

    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

      new file:   mars.txt


Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"

.. code-block:: output

    [main (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 mars.txt

When we run ``git commit``, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using ``git add``
and stores a copy permanently inside the special ``.git`` directory.
This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and its short identifier is ``f22b25e``. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the ``-m`` flag (for "message") to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment 
that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run ``git commit`` without the ``-m`` option, Git will launch ``nano`` (or whatever other editor we configured as ``core.editor``)
so that we can write a longer message.

.. hint::
   
   Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit.
   Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
   If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.
   Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run ``git status`` now:

.. code-block:: bash

   git status

.. code-block:: output

    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working tree clean

it tells us everything is up to date. If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

.. code-block:: bash

   git log

.. code-block:: output

    commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
    Author: Jon Hill <jon.hill@york.ac.uk>
    Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2023 -0400

       Start notes on Mars as a base

``git log`` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes

 - the commit's full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the ``git commit`` command earlier),
 - the commit's author,
 - when it was created,
 - and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

..  admonition:: Learn more
    :class: toggle

    **Where Are My Changes?**

   If we run ``ls`` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
   That's because Git saves information about files' history
   in the special :file:`.git` directory mentioned earlier
   so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
   (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).

Now suppose we adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with ``nano`` and then ``cat`` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to ``cat``.)

.. code-block:: bash

   nano mars.txt
   cat mars.txt

.. code-block:: output

    Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
    The two moons may be a problem for werewolves

When we run ``git status`` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

.. code-block:: bash

   git status

.. code-block:: output

    On branch main
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
     
        modified:   mars.txt
     
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

The last line is the key phrase: "no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file, but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with ``git add``) nor have we saved them (which we do with ``git commit``).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using ``git diff``.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

.. code-block:: bash

   git diff

.. code-block:: output

    diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
    index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
    --- a/mars.txt
    +++ b/mars.txt
    @@ -1 +1,2 @@
     Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
    +The two moons may be a problem for werewolves

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and ``patch``
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix ``diff`` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    ``df0654a`` and ``315bf3a`` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the ``+`` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

.. code-block:: bash

   git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"

.. code-block:: output

    On branch main
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   mars.txt

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use ``git add`` first.
Let's fix that:

.. code-block:: bash

   git add mars.txt
   git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"

.. code-block:: output

    [main 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches. For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this, Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current changeset but not yet committed.

.. admonition:: Learn more
    :class: toggle

    **Staging Area**

    If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,
    ``git add`` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot
    (putting things in the staging area),
    and ``git commit`` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and
    makes a permanent record of it (as a commit).
    If you don't have anything staged when you type ``git commit``,
    Git will prompt you to use ``git commit -a`` or ``git commit --all``,
    which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo!
    However, it's almost always better to
    explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might
    commit changes you forgot you made. (Going back to the group photo simile,
    you might get an extra with incomplete makeup walking on
    the stage for the picture because you used ``-a``!)
    Try to stage things manually,
    or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more
    than you would like!

.. image:: ../images/git-staging-area.png
   :alt: The git staging area

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area and into long-term storage.
First, we'll add another line to the file:

.. code-block:: bash

   nano mars.txt
   cat mars.txt

.. code-block:: output

    Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
    The two moons may be a problem for werewolves

So far, so good: we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column). Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what ``git diff`` reports:

.. code-block:: bash

    git add mars.txt
    git diff

There is no output: as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory. However, if we do this:

.. code-block:: bash

    git diff --staged

.. code-block:: output

    **Word-based diffing**

    Sometimes, e.g. in the case of the text documents a line-wise
    diff is too coarse. That is where the ``--color-words`` option of
    ``git diff`` comes in very useful as it highlights the changed 
    words using colors.

.. admonition:: Learn more

    **Paging the Log**

    When the output of ``git log`` is too long to fit in your screen,
    ``git`` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen.
    When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your
    screen is a ``:``, instead of your usual prompt.
    
    *   To get out of the pager, press :kbd:`q`.
    *   To move to the next page, press :kbd:`Spacebar`.
    *   To search for `some_word` in all pages, press :kbd:`/` and type ``some_word``.
        Navigate through matches pressing :kbd:`n`.

.. admonition:: Learn more
    :class: toggle

    **Limit Log Size**

    To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the
    number of commits that Git lists by using `-N`, where `N` is the number of
    commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from
    the last commit you can use:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        git log -1

    .. code-block:: output

        commit 005937fbe2a98fb83f0ade869025dc2636b4dad5 (HEAD -> main)

        Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy

    You can also reduce the quantity of information using the ``--oneline`` option:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        git log --oneline

    .. code-block:: output

        005937f (HEAD -> main) Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy
        34961b1 Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
        f22b25e Start notes on Mars as a base
    
    You can also combine the `--oneline` option with others. One useful
    combination adds `--graph` to display the commit history as a text-based
    graph and to indicate which commits are associated with the
    current `HEAD`, the current branch `main`, or
    [other Git references][git-references]:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        git log --oneline --graph

    .. code-block:: output

        * 005937f (HEAD -> main) Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy

.. caution::

    **Directories**
    
    Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.
    
    1. Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them. Try it for yourself:
      
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        mkdir spaceships
        git status
        git add spaceships
        git status
    
    Note, our newly created empty directory `spaceships` does not appear in
    the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (*via* ``git add``) to our
    repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see ``.gitkeep`` files
    in otherwise empty directories. Unlike ``.gitignore``, these files are not special
    and their sole purpose is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to
    the repository. In fact, you can name such files anything you like.
    
    2. If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files,
       you can add all files in the directory at once by:
    
    .. code-block:: bash
          
           git add <directory-with-files>
    
    Try it for yourself:
    
     .. code-block:: bash
                
         touch spaceships/apollo-11 spaceships/sputnik-1
         git status
         git add spaceships
         git status
     
    Before moving on, we will commit these changes.
    
     .. code-block:: bash
         
        git commit -m "Add some initial thoughts on spaceships"


To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(``git add``) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (``git commit``):

.. image:: ../images/git-committing.png

.. admonition:: Thought exercise

   **Choosing a Commit Message**
   
   Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
   last commit made to `mars.txt`?
   
   1. "Changes"
   2. "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt"
   3. "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear;
    and answer 2 is redundant to using "git diff" to see what changed in this commit;
    but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.

.. admonition:: Thought exercise

   **Committing changes to Git**
    
   Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
   to my local Git repository?

   1. ``$ git commit -m "my recent changes"``
   2. ``git init myfile.txt``
      ``git commit -m "my recent changes"``
   3. ``git add myfile.txt``
      ``git commit -m "my recent changes"``
   4. ``git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"``

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
    2. Would try to create a new repository.
    3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
    4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.


.. admonition:: Practical exercise

   **Committing multiple files**
    
   The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
   that you want to commit as a single snapshot.
   
   1. Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision
      to consider Venus as a base
   2. Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts
      about Venus as a base for you and your friends
   3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
      and commit those changes.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    The output below from `cat mars.txt` reflects only content added during 
    this exercise. Your output may vary.
    
    First we make our changes to the `mars.txt` and `venus.txt` files:

    .. code-block:: bash

        nano mars.txt
        cat mars.txt

    .. code-block:: output

        Maybe I should start with a base on Venus.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        nano venus.txt
        cat venus.txt

    .. code-block:: output

        Venus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.

    Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:
    
    .. code-block:: bash
        
        git add mars.txt venus.txt

    Or with multiple commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git add mars.txt
        git add venus.txt

    Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        git commit -m "Write plans to start a base on Venus"

    .. code-block:: output

        [main cc127c2]

    **Creating a biography**

    * Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
    * Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`,
      commit your changes
    * Modify one line, add a fourth line
    * Display the differences between its updated state and its original state.


.. admonition:: Solution

    If needed, move out of the `planets` folder:

        cd ..

    Create a new folder called `bio` and 'move' into it:

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir bio
        cd bio

    Initialise git:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git init

    Create your biography file `me.txt` using `nano` or another text editor.
    Once in place, add and commit it to the repository:

    .. code-block:: bash

        git add me.txt
        git commit -m "Add biography file" 

    Modify the file as described (modify one line, add a fourth line).
    To display the differences between its updated state and its original state, use `git diff`:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        git diff me.txt
