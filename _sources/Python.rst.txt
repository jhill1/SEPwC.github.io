Python: the fundementals
=========================

We're now going to learn the basics of a language. If you've chosen 
Python, keep reading. If you've choosen R :ref:`go to this section<R: the fundementals>`.

Computer languages are much simpler than natural langauages, but much
stricter. We have to get the syntax correct or things won't work. However
interpreted languages tell you what is wrong, so it's not as bad as it sounds.
