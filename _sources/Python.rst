Python: the fundamentals
=========================

We're now going to learn the basics of a language. If you've chosen 
Python, keep reading. If you've choose R :ref:`go to this section<R: the fundamentals>`.

Computer languages are much simpler than natural languages, but much
stricter. We have to get the syntax correct or things won't work. However
interpreted languages tell you what is wrong, so it's not as bad as it sounds.

Python tools of the trade
---------------------------

On windows, I would recommend installing `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/>_`.
This gives you an Anaconda terminal. Use this to install modules and run your scripts. I would also
install `Spyder IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>_` as an IDE and editor. You may need to swap the default
Python interpreter to your Anaconda install.

On Linux, make sure your Python is up-to-date and install `Spyder IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>_`, but
I'm old-fashioned and just use a text editor (`vim` if you care).

On MacOS, I would recommend installing Python via `HomeBrew <https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python>_`. 
A good text editor is recommended over Spyder however. It can be tricky to get Spyder to work with the HomeBrew Python.

This is one of the major issues with Python; it is very flexible, but the conflicting installations of modules means solutions
such as virtual environment are common, where a whole new Python environment is created for a single application.
