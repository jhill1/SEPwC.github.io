=================

This course was developed in my mind over many years. I jumped at the opportunity to make it real. It is influenced
by a number of collaborators and colleagues. Thanks to the Software Carpentry initiative for their courses, training
and influence. The git-novice course was the influence for the Git section. Thanks to colleagues David Ham, Colin Cotter
and Lawrence Mitchel who created courses at their institutions which influenced me greatly. Thanks to Marijan Beg at Imperial
College London for making his Python course open. I borrowed material from there for the Python and R sections. I also
borrowed ideas from Hadley Wickham's various R books and websites.

Thanks need to go to Katie Lee and Holly Smith for recording a large number of the videos on this website; thanks both!

Thanks also to the fantastic group of developers that have made all the software used here. R, Python, Sphinx, Linux, 
matplotlib, ggplot2, numpy, gdal, etc. The list should go on, but there is simply too much. The fact that so much of this
software is free (in terms of beer and speech) is amazing.
